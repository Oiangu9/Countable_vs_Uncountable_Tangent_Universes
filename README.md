It is well known [1,2,3] that the Schr√∂dinger Equation (which is a complex partial differential equation) can be decomposed into two real partial differential equations, by writing the wavefunction $\psi(\vec{x},t)$ in polar form. If the gradient of the phase of the wavefunction is interpreted as the configuration-space momentum of the described particles,
